# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# TODO file for G4-SSN netowrking code (OEDSR,AODV,ADFS etc)
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# IMPORTANT: Entries should be split into groups: 
#	SMALL changes
#	LARGE chages, 
#	NEW PROTOCOLS AND MAJOR FEATURES
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#

#	NEW PROTOCOLS AND MAJOR FEATURES
P.1 - congestion control
P.2 - power control

#	LARGE chages
L.1 - handle dropped packets (detect and count)
L.2 - add flow statistics (e.g. throughout)
L.3 - add queue statistics
L.4 - modify TEST DATA packet to include statistics
L.5 - initialization of the radio (baudrate + API)

PENDING:
void phy_start_tx_process() - add implementation of adaptive back-off


#	SMALL changes

S.1 - Update UART libraries to be modular and support UART_0 and UART_1
S.2 - Comfort UART and SPI and ...??? (serial interfaces)
S.3 - Create API for high level applications ("destination-" and "dest+interface-" selectabel)
S.4 - Check NEW Config size
S.5 - Send negative ACK to malformated New Config

#	CURRENT Tasks
C.0 - start limiting the out flow (similar to ADFS but with lower CW)
C.1 - while dequing pkt then check if exceeded number of packets per period -> limit!??
C.2 - handle sending of inflow limit requests (make sure that it is received)
C.2b - check if received ACK_OK for inflow limit request
C.3 - allow at least one packet out per period
