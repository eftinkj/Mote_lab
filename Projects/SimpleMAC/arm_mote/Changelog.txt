	@TITLE - Added timeout SCHeduler ("sch_" prefix)
	- added "scheduler" subfolder with files and "Scheduler_GR" files group 
	- to enable Scheduler - define "_ENABLE_SCH_BASIC_" in "feat_enable.h"
	- created basic structures, variables, and functions
	**- added basic functionality of setting timeout at specific time (RTC ticks)
	**- added check of timeout and execution "callback" function


07/30/2007 - Maciej Zawodniok
	@TITLE - New Project added and more cleanup
	- added "PRJ_CAMT_Headset_01" project (voice communication)
	- fixed TSP support for sending a packet (reserve, access and send the packet via Queue buffer)
	- Utility Monitoring project will periodically send all the main parameters out (3-phase power: 
		active, reactive and apparent) plus the raw ADC data from acelerometer and temp sensor


07/30/2007 - Maciej Zawodniok
	@TITLE - Masive change of structure, modularization and additions
	- added SPI interface code (API)
	- added PWM (8-bit mode) interface (API) using PCA implementation and Timer 0 frequency control
	- added common system functions (e.g. error reporting)
	- added transport layer to enable pseudo-sockets
	- project/application specific files are to be stored in subdirectories
	   e.g. "robotics_01" contains files configuring remote control of a truck
	   "PRJ_NEM_Utilities_01" contains code for NEM Utility Monitoring project
	- constants and hardware definitions (ports and special registers of 8051)
		are stored in "defs" subdir
	- every file should include "defs/esnl_pub.h" at the very begining
	- code becomes modular (e.g. code for robotics_01 can be excluded from compilation)
		definition directives are stored in 
		a) "hw_specific.h" - applications and mote hardware versions
		b) "feat_enable.h" - modules/protocols/features 
	- begin splitting header files into "_pub.h" and "_prv.h" sections
	- several smaller changes
	
04/30/2007 - Maciej Zawodniok
	@TITLE Enabling channel switching coordinated by BS
	- Support for setting up a switching schedule with first timeout
		interval, and two alternating channels
	- Node will send JOIN message with current time after each switch
		** The nodes send multiple JOIN messages per switch ????? (but not always -> time scewe)
	- Added check for UART overfloww/out-of-range indexes of buffers (resets them)
		** noticed a lot of cases when after running some time the nodes "get" these indexes out of range
	- ** Periodically the ADC parameters get reset to some standard values
	- Disabled tick overflow counter since it was triggered too often, and in undetermined scenarios/case
	- Added IGNORE case for OEDSR energy from NEW CONFIG
	- Added DISABLE energy simulation value and handling (saturate energy for OEDSR)
		** it is actually still counted but since it is set to MAX there will be no stop in reasonable time frame


04/20/2007 - Maciej Zawodniok
	@TITLE Merging of code
	- Merged with James ADFS code
	- Fixed Merge issues


04/02/2007 - Maciej Zawodniok

	- AES implementation is prepared by Eyad Taqieddin
	- keys storage implementation is prepared by Eyad Taqieddin


03/20/2007 - Maciej Zawodniok
	@TITLE JNL version of Implementation of Predictive Congestion Control
	- Imlemented ourgoing flow control using timeouts
		- the adaptation is implemnted thorugh it does not use channel informations!!
	- Modified communication to pass the inflow limit to upstream nodes via BROADCAST
		- this limits overhead due to implementation of feedback as separate packet
		- according to design it should be included in the ACK frame
		- the default backoff interval for last hopnode  (before BS) is fixed at (-1) 
		  to accomodate for the BCAST message interference
	- Extended hoplist V2 informations to  include per period: throughout, predicted throughput, 
		calculated inflow, droprate, 
		and current (!!) queue level (always excluding the current packet hence [Q <= MAX-1])

03/14/2007 - Maciej Zawodniok
	@TITLE Implementation of Predictive Congestion Control
	- Added prediction of the outgoing flow
	- Added communication to pass the inflow limit to upstream node
	- Applied inflow limit for own sources
	- Implemented Hoplist v2 in the modular test packet
	- Added configuration options for PCC for physical layer (backoff)
	- Added configuration case for SFQ and PCC backoff
	- Topology setup of PCC is hardcoded (upstream nodes and flows)
	- Implemented PCC backoff using ED AT commands - BUT IT HAS ISSUES!!
		possible causes are: interleaving with PCC upstream messages

02/20/2007 - Maciej Zawodniok
	@TITLE Merged with newest Routing and Scheduling

02/20/2007 - Maciej Zawodniok
	@TITLE Modularize CongestionControl functionality
	- Added #ifdef's around the "cc_*" funcions and variables

02/12/2007 - Maciej Zawodniok
	@TITLE Preparing framework for the congestion control implementation
	- Created "CongestionControl.h" and "CongestionControl.c" files
	- Added basic periodic processing (update of all interated parameters)
	- Added calculation of outgoing throughout
	- Added transmission of the outgoing throughput to BS inside test messages
	- Added New test data packet flags and corresponding data structures
	- Cleaned up packet flags:
		- Added Arbitrary Data flag (0x73)
		- Added Test Data Ver. 2 flag (0x75)
		- Added Test Data Empty flag (for reference) (0x76)
		- Added Modular Data flag (0x74) (modular content - e.g. ADFS weights, encoding of ADC ets)
		- Moved GOODBY flag to 0x77 (previously 0x73)

02/10/2007 - Maciej Zawodniok
	@TITLE Initialization of XBee radio -> baudrate scan and setting + enabling API mode 
	- Added "error_lock(repeat)" function to comunicate errors via LED blinks
	- Added "fix_XBee_baudrate()" function to "AT_scripts.*" to handle function
	- Added Macros for sending AT commands in exclusive AT mode ("+++"->only AT cmd)
	- After (persistently) fixing the baudrate is set to default (115kbps) and API enabled

02/06/2007 - Maciej Zawodniok
	@TITLE Merged changes from the Routing and Scheduling branch
	- Updated TODO for Congestion control

###############################################
###  Switched to Congestion Control Branch  ###
###############################################

01/23/2007 - Maciej Zawodniok
	@TITLE Fixed backoff setting for default case (No backoff + no SFQ queuing)
	- Modified "app_recvConfigSensor" function for "ISN_APP_CONFIG_FLAG_PROTOCOLS" flag

01/23/2007 - Maciej Zawodniok
	@TITLE Merged the fixed power level switching
	- Added "current_power_level_" variable to store current radio settings
	- The meaning of the "my_power_level_" is changed to "configuration" setting
	- Revised the power level update functions (received new_config and set power level)

01/23/2007 - JWF
	@TITLE Fixed Power Level Switching
	- Corrected phy_set_power_level and the configuration function to preserve the power level
		- when switching the power level the function would overwrite the default level and not return to the default/set level from maximum.

01/19/2007 - JWF
	@TITLE Fixed Routing when CH is assigned
	- Added check at routing_receive_packet() function in the beam packet section
		- Checks to see if it is a CH before routing, otherwise should talk to CH.	

01/10/2007- James W. Fonda (JWF)
	@TITLE Configuration Return Packet Modified
	- Added all parameters of intrest to the app_sendConfigSensor() and corresponding structure
	- Added the RSSI of the config packet to the app_sendConfigSensor()

12/20/2006 - Maciej Zawodniok
	@TITLE Enabling the Back-off method via the API
	- SFQ implementation is modular at compilation-lavel (can be disabled)
	- Scheduling protocol (queuing and backoff) can be set via NEW_CONFIG
	- Back-off-aware transmission can be enabled and configured via NEW_CONFIG
	- Queuing scheme can be switched via NEW_CONFIG
	- some code cleaning up


12/06/2006 - Maciej Zawodniok

	- portability to SDCC resolved (still memory allocation is an issue!!)
	- fix setting of RF power level
	- add configuration of RF retries (in steps of 3 retries) -> Maxstream specific
