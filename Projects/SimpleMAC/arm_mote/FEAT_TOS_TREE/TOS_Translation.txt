1) Filenames:
Tree.h -> as is
Tree.nc -> "*.pub.h" defines public functions accessible from outside
TreeC.ns -> "*.pub.c" includes function which connects the class with the TOS functions/interfaces 
			-> should be power_up() function of the module to tie it with system calls
TreeM.nc -> "*.c" includes the main (private) implementation of the module/class

2) C.nc
- Added" "#include "defs/esnl_pub.h"" as first line 
- T: "includes Tree;" => "#include "Tree.h" ??
- T: "configuration TreeC {" => "void TreeC"
- T: "provides interface Tree;" => "//: public Tree" (COMMENT OUT?, if CONFIGURATION is only power_up() function then there is no need for a class
- T: "} implementation {" => " { // Implementation
